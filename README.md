## Overview
RecordPoint allows for the export of a maximum of 20 metadata fields to a CSV file. Using [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/) scripting, this CSV file is used to trigger a disposition workflow in a SharePoint library which exports its scheduled files, along with the CSV file, to a Secure FTP (SFTP) site. The current timestamp is used as the folder name for the export, see for example [`/data/2021-03-02_10-24`](https://github.com/artefactual-labs/RP-2-AM/tree/main/data/2021-03-02_10-24). 

Archivematica then runs a script to retrieve these files and convert the export folder and CSV data into transfer packages that can be ingested into Archivematica. See [`/data/transfers`](https://github.com/artefactual-labs/RP-2-AM/tree/main/data/transfers).

Once the tranfer has been processed by Archivematica it produces an Archival Information Package (AIP). This contains the RecordPoint metadata in its METS XML file, the original files, and any preservation copies of the files, if applicable as per the Archivematica installation's Format Policy Registry (FPR) rules. See [`/data/AIPs`](https://github.com/artefactual-labs/RP-2-AM/tree/main/data/AIPs).

This table shows those RecordPoint CSV fields that are matched to a Dublin Core field in the Archivematica AIP METS file. The remaining fields are retained in the METS file's "OTHER" descriptive metadata (DMD) section.
